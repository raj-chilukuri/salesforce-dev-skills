# sf-diagram-nanobananapro

## Overview

Guidance for creating polished visual outputs for architecture and UX communication, with emphasis on traceability back to source requirements.

## When to Use

- Producing presentation-grade architecture visuals
- Creating UI mockups for LWC and experience flows
- Preparing stakeholder-ready design collateral

## Core Responsibilities

- Translate technical requirements into visual structure
- Maintain consistency with actual system boundaries
- Capture design rationale and review feedback loops
- Provide handoff-ready artifacts with version notes

## Workflow

1. Confirm artifact objective and audience.
2. Collect source requirements, entities, and interactions.
3. Draft visual layout with hierarchy and focus.
4. Validate technical accuracy against system design.
5. Iterate based on review feedback.
6. Deliver final artifact and change log.

## Commands

```bash
# Tool-specific command usage depends on local visual generation setup.
# Keep workflow reproducible and documented in team runbooks.
```

## Guardrails

- Do not publish visuals that conflict with source architecture.
- Separate exploratory concepts from approved design.
- Keep revision history for review accountability.
- Avoid style-heavy artifacts that hide key technical details.

## Output Contract

- Final visual artifact(s)
- Design rationale and assumptions
- Reviewer feedback resolution summary
- Handoff notes for implementation teams
